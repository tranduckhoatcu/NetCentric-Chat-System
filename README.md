# NetCentric Chat System

 A simple chat system using Sockets in C!
  - Using UDP Socket (we love our users therefore we don't care about their data loss)
  - Support multiple clients (maximum 2 clients)
  - Implement in c/c++ programing language (which is considered as a terrible idea but we want to pass this course)
